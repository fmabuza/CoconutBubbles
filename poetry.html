<pre class="poem">Demon Ink<p>This pen of mine is the reason for all my insanity

Believe me my love, I only meant to write.

To praise you, to love you

To worship you, to adore you with the words of my heart

But that demon ink found the darkest corners inside me

So I  had tell you my love

I had to say it

 

It was not me who wrote the words

It was not me who called you names

I forgot to forgive you and my pen found out

 

The letter you found was not meant for you 

It was not me who wrote it

It was this pen of mine my love.

That demon ink.</p><pre>








<pre class="poem">How to Eat a Peach<p>Before biting and tasting
Squeeze.
Press for ripeness and
Readiness and
Willingness to be devoured.
With peach to mouth
And teeth to skin
Before biting
And licking
And sucking
Inhale
Take a good long whiff;
Like you would when soaking
In a bath: make it last
For as long as it’ll go on
The warmth of the water enveloping
Your cold skin,
The sugar hugging your nostrils.
Enjoy it with your whole body.

With peach to mouth
And teeth to skin
Do as you would when you read
A book:
Be transported and savor the best part
The biting or the chewing
The chewing or the swallowing…your pick.
Each word, each bite is a feeling,
A yearning satisfied.

Sometimes,
And half of the time always
The wanting is greater than the
Having, but
When you eat a peach right,
That’s never the case.

<pre class="poem">Blue Jerusalem<p>
They ashed their cigarettes on our heads
I felt the pain but never satisfied their grins
I hid it  inside my love...I hid it inside.

They carved their names on our heads,
wore our teeth around their necks but
I didn't cry my love...I didn't cry.

They broke our bones and made us bleed, 
scarred our skin and stole our dreams but
I didn't avenge them my love...I couldn't.

They made bets on the weakest minds
on who screams loud and bleeds long but
I forgave them my love...I forgave them.

I saw things you could never see my love,
horrors you couldn't phantom.
Electrical storms that strike,
burning bodies praying.

I hid the pain and bit back tears, I did
what I was told and never said a word,
for it was just a dream my love...it was just a dream.

<pre class="poem">Love's Suicide<p>Drown me
Baptize me with death
Hurt me so bad it feels good 
Banish me
I just want to die
I want to expire in your arms
And cease to be
Only you can hurt me
Can hurt me so bad
Bury me
Burn inside of me until I burst into flames
I just want to die
I want to perish with your arms around me
Nothing is enough
Breathing digs my grave
Swallow me
Hold me inside your mouth until I 
Dissolve into you and disappear
Inside of you
Envelope me with your hair
I can’t live
I just want to die loving you
Breathing you
Wanting you
Freeze me
Never melt me
Take hold of my soul and never give it back 
I bleed you
I infect myself with you
And die with every breath you take
I’m hypnotized by you 
Consumed under your spell
I hunger for you
Crave your every fiber
I can’t help but love you unconditionally
Confine me
Run through me like a fever
Don’t let me go.
