                    Believe me my love, I only meant to write.

                    To praise you, to love you

                    To worship you, to adore you with the words of my heart

                    But that demon ink found the darkest corners inside me

                    So I  had tell you my love

                    I had to say it



                    It was not me who wrote the words

                    It was not me who called you names

                    I forgot to forgive you and my pen found out



                    The letter you found was not meant for you 

                    It was not me who wrote it

                    It was this pen of mine my love.

                    That demon ink.</h4></p></pre>

                    <h4>Before biting and tasting
                    Squeeze.
                    Press for ripeness and
                    Readiness and
                    Willingness to be devoured.
                    With peach to mouth
                    And teeth to skin
                    Before biting
                    And licking
                    And sucking
                    Inhale
                    Take a good long whiff;
                    Like you would when soaking
                    In a bath: make it last
                    For as long as it’ll go on
                    The warmth of the water enveloping
                    Your cold skin,
                    The sugar hugging your nostrils.
                    Enjoy it with your whole body.

                    With peach to mouth
                    And teeth to skin
                    Do as you would when you read
                    A book:
                    Be transported and savor the best part
                    The biting or the chewing
                    The chewing or the swallowing…your pick.
                    Each word, each bite is a feeling,
                    A yearning satisfied.

                    Sometimes,
                    And half of the time always
                    The wanting is greater than the
                    Having, but
                    When you eat a peach right,
                    That’s never the case.

                    <h4>They ashed their cigarettes on our heads
                    I felt the pain but never satisfied their grins
                    I hid it  inside my love...I hid it inside.

                    They carved their names on our heads,
                    wore our teeth around their necks but
                    I didn't cry my love...I didn't cry.

                    They broke our bones and made us bleed, 
                    scarred our skin and stole our dreams but
                    I didn't avenge them my love...I couldn't.

                    They made bets on the weakest minds
                    on who screams loud and bleeds long but
                    I forgave them my love...I forgave them.

                    I saw things you could never see my love,
                    horrors you couldn't phantom.
                    Electrical storms that strike,
                    burning bodies praying.

                    I hid the pain and bit back tears, I did
                    what I was told and never said a word,
                    for it was just a dream my love...it was just a dream.

                    I infect myself with you
                    And die with every breath you take
                    I’m hypnotized by you 
                    Consumed under your spell
                    I hunger for you
                    Crave your every fiber

                    Confine me
                    Run through me like a fever
                    Don’t let me go.
